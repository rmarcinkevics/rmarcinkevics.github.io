Ah yes, I've been expecting you! 

Anyways, my name is Ričards Marcinkevičs (rɪʧɑrdz mɑrtsɪnkɛvɪʧ; Russian: *Ричард Марцинкевич*). I was born in <a href="images/Riga.png" style="color: black; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">Rīga, Latvia</a>, in 1995. Currently, I am a PhD student at the [Institute for Machine Learning](https://ml.inf.ethz.ch/), [Department of Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/), [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). I am a [Medical Data Science group](https://mds.inf.ethz.ch/) member supervised by [Prof. Dr. Julia E. Vogt](https://mds.inf.ethz.ch/team/detail/julia-vogt) and co-advised by [Prof. Dr. Fanny Yang](https://sml.inf.ethz.ch/group/fannyy/).

Before pursuing a doctoral degree, I obtained an M.Sc. in Statistics at the [Seminar for Statistics](https://math.ethz.ch/sfs), ETH Zürich, and a B.Sc. in Knowledge Engineering and Data Science at the [Department of Data Science and Knowledge Engineering (DKE)](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/department-data-science-and-knowledge-engineering-dke), [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/). During my master's thesis, I worked on [causal inference in time series for identifying molecular fingerprints during sleep](files/Master_Thesis_RMarcinkevics.pdf) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Joachim M. Buhmann](https://inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.buhmann.html) and [Đorđe Miladinović](https://djordjemila.github.io/). During my bachelor's, I interned for two years at the [Medtronic](https://europe.medtronic.com/xd-en/our-company/key-facts.html) [Bakken Research Center (BRC)](https://www.medtronic.com/nl-nl/about/medtronic-netherlands/bakken-research-center.html) in Maastricht.

In my leisure time, I enjoy learning about classic Russian literature and ancient history. Like many Latvians, I love contemplating the meaning of life by the [Baltic Sea](images/baltic_sea.jpg) and occasional [angling](images/angling.jpg).
