Ah yes, I've been expecting you! 

Anyways, my name is Ričards Marcinkevičs (rɪʧɑrdz mɑrtsɪnkɛvɪʧ; Russian: *Ричард Марцинкевич*). I was born in [Rīga, Latvia](images/Riga.png) in 1995. Currently, I am a PhD student at the [Institute for Machine Learning](https://ml.inf.ethz.ch/), [Department of Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/), [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). 

I am a [Medical Data Science group](https://mds.inf.ethz.ch/) member and am supervised by [Prof Dr Julia E. Vogt](https://mds.inf.ethz.ch/team/detail/julia-vogt) and co-advised by [Prof Dr Fanny Yang](https://sml.inf.ethz.ch/group/fannyy/).

Before pursuing a doctoral degree, I obtained an MSc in Statistics at the [Seminar for Statistics](https://math.ethz.ch/sfs), ETH Zürich, and a BSc in Knowledge Engineering and Data Science at the [Department of Data Science and Knowledge Engineering (DKE)](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/department-data-science-and-knowledge-engineering-dke), [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/). During my master's thesis, I have worked on [causal inference in time series for identifying molecular fingerprints during sleep](files/Master_Thesis_RMarcinkevics.pdf) under the supervision of [Prof Dr Joachim M. Buhmann](https://inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.buhmann.html) and [Đorđe Miladinović](https://djordjemila.github.io/).
