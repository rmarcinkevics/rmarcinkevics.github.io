Ah yes, I've been expecting you! Anyways, my name is Ričards Marcinkevičs (rɪʧɑrdz mɑrtsɪnkɛvɪʧ; Russian: Ричард Марцинкевич). I was born in [Rīga, Latvia](images/Riga.png) in 1995. I am a PhD student at the [Institute for Machine Learning](https://ml.inf.ethz.ch/), [Department of Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/), [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html).
